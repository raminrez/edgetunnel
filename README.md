# üöÄ edgetunnel
This is a script based on the CF Worker platform, modified from the original version to display VLESS configuration information and convert it into subscription content. With this script, you can easily convert VLESS configuration information into tools like Clash or Singbox using online configuration conversion.

## üî• Risk Warning
- Avoid leaking node configuration information by submitting fake node configurations to the subscription service.
- Alternatively, you can choose to deploy the [WorkerVless2sub subscription generation service](https://github.com/cmliu/WorkerVless2sub) yourself, so you can take advantage of the convenience of the subscription generator.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workers Deployment Method [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKe9xUuFODA&t=191s)

<details>
<summary><code><strong>"Workers Deployment Text Tutorial"</strong></code></summary>

1. Deploy CF Worker:
   - Create a new Worker in the CF Worker console.
   - Paste the content of [worker.js](https://github.com/cmliu/edgetunnel/blob/main/_worker.js) into the Worker editor.
   - Change the `userID` on line 4 to your own **UUID**.

2. Access subscription content:
   - Visit `https://[YOUR-WORKERS-URL]/[UUID]` to get the subscription content.
   - For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10` is your universal adaptive subscription address.
   - For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sub` is the Base64 subscription format, suitable for PassWall, SSR+, etc.
   - For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?clash` is the Clash subscription format, suitable for OpenClash, etc.
   - For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sb` is the singbox subscription format, suitable for singbox, etc.

3. Bind a custom domain to workers:
   - In the workers console, under the `Triggers` tab, click `Add Custom Domain`.
   - Enter the subdomain you have transferred to the CF domain name resolution service, for example: `vless.google.com`, then click `Add Custom Domain` and wait for the certificate to take effect.
   - **If you are a beginner, you can take off now, you don't need to read any further!!!**

4. Use your own `preferred domain`/`preferred IP` subscription content:
   - If you want to use your own preferred domain or preferred IP, you can refer to the deployment instructions in the [WorkerVless2sub GitHub repository](https://github.com/cmliu/WorkerVless2sub) to build it yourself.
   - Open the [worker.js](https://github.com/cmliu/edgetunnel/blob/main/_worker.js) file, find the `sub` variable on line 12, and change it to the address of your deployed subscription generator. For example, `let sub = 'sub.cmliussss.workers.dev';`, note that you should not include protocol information and symbols such as https.
   - Note that if you use your own subscription address, the `sub` domain of the subscription generator and the domain of `[YOUR-WORKER-URL]` must not belong to the same top-level domain, otherwise an exception will occur. You can assign the domain assigned by workers.dev to the `sub` variable.

   - Enter your custom subdomain, be careful not to use your root domain, for example:
     If the domain assigned to you is `fuck.cloudns.biz`, then enter `lizi.fuck.cloudns.biz` for the custom domain;
   - Follow CF's requirements to return to your domain's DNS service provider, add a CNAME record `edgetunnel.pages.dev` for this custom domain `lizi`, and then click `Activate domain`.
   - **If you are a beginner, then after your pages are bound to a `custom domain`, you can take off directly, you don't need to read any further!!!**

4. Use your own `preferred domain`/`preferred IP` subscription content:
   - If you want to use your own preferred domain or preferred IP, you can refer to the deployment instructions in the [WorkerVless2sub GitHub repository](https://github.com/cmliu/WorkerVless2sub) to build it yourself.
   - In the Pages console, under the `Settings` tab, select `Environment variables` > `Production` > `Edit variables` > `Add variable`;
   - Set the variable name to `SUB` and the corresponding value to the address of your deployed subscription generator. For example, `sub.cmliussss.workers.dev`, then click **Save**.
   - Then in the Pages console, under the `Deployments` tab, select `All deployments` > `...` on the far right of the latest deployment > `Retry deployment`.
   - Note that if you use your own subscription address, the `SUB` domain of the subscription generator and the domain of `[YOUR-PAGES-URL]` must not belong to the same top-level domain, otherwise an exception will occur. You can assign the domain assigned by Pages.dev to the `SUB` variable.

## ‚ùó Notes

### Enable online editing of preferred list [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKe9xUuFODA&t=630s)
- Bind a **KV namespace** with the **variable name** `KV` to enable online editing of the `ADD` and `ADDAPI` preferred lists on the configuration page without `SUB`;

### **About `KEY` and `UUID`:**
- After filling in the `KEY` variable, the `UUID` variable will be disabled. Please make sure to **use one of them**!
1. After filling in `KEY`, your **permanent subscription** address is: `https://[YOUR-URL]/[YOUR-KEY]`;
2. When using a dynamic `UUID` subscription:
   - The dynamic `UUID` needs to be obtained manually on the permanent subscription configuration page;
   - The temporary subscription address is: `https://[YOUR-URL]/[dynamic UUID]`;
   - The subscription validity period is: **1 `TIME` cycle**;
   - The node can be used for: **2 `TIME` cycles**, that is, after the dynamic `UUID` expires, the node can still be used for an additional cycle, but the subscription cannot be updated.

### **About `SOCKS5` and `PROXYIP`:**
- After filling in `SOCKS5`, `PROXYIP` will be disabled. Please make sure to **use one of them**!

### **About `SUB` and `ADD*` variables:**
- After filling in `SUB`, the subscription content generated by the `ADD*` class variables will be disabled. Please make sure to **use one of them**!

### **When `SUB` and `ADD*` are both empty:**
- The script will automatically generate lines based on random CF IPs. Each time the subscription is updated, a different random IP will be generated to ensure that your subscription will not be lost!


## üîß Practical Skills
This project provides a flexible subscription configuration solution that supports rapid customization of subscription content through URL parameters.
- Example subscription address: `https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10`

1. Change the subscription address of the **subscription generator** [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKe9xUuFODA&t=1019s)

   Quickly switch the subscription generator to `VLESS.cmliussss.net`:
   ```url
   https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sub=VLESS.cmliussss.net
   ```

2. Change the subscription address of **PROXYIP** [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKe9xUuFODA&t=1094s)

   Quickly change PROXYIP to `proxyip.cmliussss.net`:
   ```url
   https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?proxyip=proxyip.cmliussss.net
   ```

3. Change the subscription address of **SOCKS5**

   Quickly set the SOCKS5 proxy to `user:password@127.0.0.1:1080`:
   ```url
   https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?socks5=user:password@127.0.0.1:1080
   ```

- Quickly modify the subscription address by submitting multiple parameters

   For example, modify both the **subscription generator** and **PROXYIP** at the same time:
   ```url
   https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sub=VLESS.cmliussss.net&proxyip=proxyip.cmliussss.net
   ```

4. The nodes deployed by this project can use the specified `PROXYIP` or `SOCKS5` through the node PATH!!!**

- Specify `PROXYIP` case
   ```url
   /proxyip=proxyip.cmliussss.net
   /?proxyip=proxyip.cmliussss.net
   /proxyip.cmliussss.net (only for domains starting with 'proxyip.')
   ```

- Specify `SOCKS5` case
   ```url
   /socks5=user:password@127.0.0.1:1080
   /?socks5=user:password@127.0.0.1:1080
   /socks://dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==@127.0.0.1:1080 (global SOCKS5 is activated by default)
   /socks5://user:password@127.0.0.1:1080 (global SOCKS5 is activated by default)
   ```

- Specify `HTTP proxy` case
   ```url
   /http://user:password@127.0.0.1:8080 (global SOCKS5 is activated by default)
   ```

5. **When your `ADDAPI` can be used as `PROXYIP`, you can add `?proxyip=true` to the end of the `ADDAPI` variable, so that the preferred IP itself can be used as `PROXYIP` when generating nodes**
- Specify `ADDAPI` as `PROXYIP` case
   ```url
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmliu/WorkerVless2sub/main/addressesapi.txt?proxyip=true
   ```
